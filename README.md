# DNP Exercises 06 - Unit Testing and TDD


## Basic Unit testing in .NET

In this exercise you are provided a project in [./exercise_01/](./exercise_1) to start out with. Take a look at the classes in `GameModel` and implement the empty tests in `GameModel.Tests`. Try to figure out what you should test from the names of the test methods.

Follow the principles from [Unit Testing Best Pracices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-best-practices#best-practices).

## Unit Test Project Setup
